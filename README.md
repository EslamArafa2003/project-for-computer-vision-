# Project Overview
This project aims to classify images using advanced deep learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViT). The project covers various aspects of computer vision, such as data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

# Technologies and Tools Used
Python: The main programming language for the project.
PyTorch: Used for building and training deep learning models.
Torchvision: Employed for data transformations and loading pre-trained models.
NumPy: Utilized for numerical operations.
Matplotlib: Used for visualizing data and results.

# Project Workflow
# Data Preparation
Loaded and preprocessed the dataset, which involved resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and creating data loaders for efficient batching and shuffling.

# Model Building
Built CNN and ViT models. For CNNs, several layers of convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers were used. For ViTs, implemented patch embeddings and transformer encoder layers.

# Training
Trained the models using the training dataset. Employed loss functions like Cross-Entropy Loss and optimizers like Adam to minimize the loss.
Implemented techniques to handle overfitting, such as dropout and data augmentation.

# Evaluation
Evaluated the models using the test dataset. Calculated metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure performance.
Visualized the results to understand the modelâ€™s performance on different classes.

# Inference
Deployed the trained models to classify new images. Implemented functions to load the model and make predictions on unseen data.

# Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrated the application of CNNs and ViTs in image classification. The models achieved good accuracy and provided insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different architectures in handling image data.

This project showcases the practical implementation of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in computer vision, providing a solid foundation for further exploration and development in this field.
